# Electric Evolution E-Bike Shop Service Tracker
# PROJECT PLAN

## Project Overview

The Electric Evolution E-Bike Shop Service Tracker is a comprehensive web-based system designed to streamline the management of bike service operations. This locally-hosted application will enable staff to efficiently track service tickets, manage customer relationships, monitor inventory, and analyze business performance.

  - Problem description
  - Technician diagnosis
  - Parts required with costs
  - Labor charges
  - Auto-generated ticket number
  - Estimated completion date
  - Priority level (Low/Medium/High/Urgent)
  
- **Update Ticket Status**
  - Intake → Diagnosis → Awaiting Parts → In Progress → Complete → Delivered
  - Status change timestamps
  - Staff notes and updates

- **Ticket Archiving**
  - Archive completed tickets
  - Restore archived tickets when needed
  - View archive separately from active tickets

### 2. Search and Filter System
- Search by customer name, phone, ticket number
- Filter by:
  - Status
  - Date range (created/due)
  - Priority level
  - Technician assigned
  - Bike type

### 3. Customer Management
- Customer profiles with contact information
- Service history
- Multiple bikes per customer

### 4. Inventory Tracking
- Parts usage tracking
- Low stock alerts
- Cost vs. retail price tracking

### 5. Financial Tracking
- Revenue per ticket
- Labor vs. parts breakdown
- Profit margins calculation
- Monthly/quarterly reports

### 6. User Management
- Staff accounts with login credentials
- Basic role-based permissions (Admin vs. Technician)
- Activity logging

### 7. Data Backup
- Automated backups to Dropbox
- Manual backup option

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18
- **State Management**: React Context API + hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Component Structure**:
  - Layout components (Header, Sidebar, Footer)
  - Page components (Dashboard, TicketList, TicketDetail, etc.)
  - Reusable UI components (Buttons, Forms, Modals, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python 3.9+)
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints
- **Authentication**: JWT token-based auth
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic schemas
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with async support
- **Database**: SQLite (with option to upgrade to PostgreSQL)

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Staff account information
- **Customers Table**: Customer contact information
- **Bikes Table**: Bike specifications (related to customers)
- **Tickets Table**: Service ticket details
- **TicketUpdates Table**: Timeline of status changes and notes
- **Parts Table**: Inventory of parts
- **TicketParts Table**: Junction table linking tickets to parts
- **Services Table**: Labor/service options with pricing
